This is a latex class and bibliography style that implements the New Zealand Law Style Guide.

It relies on xelatex (to provide fonts expected by universities), and biblatex (with biber) for citations.

A large amount of the core functionality has been implemented (all of chapter 3, most of chapters 4, 5, 6 and 7 and some of 10) . 
However, it it not currently complete. If you find any bugs or would like any features implemented add them to the issue tracker, and I will attempt to address them.
All the formatting is done based on the assumption that this is for university work. Class options to allow for general work will be added at a later date (or if requested).
